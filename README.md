# Two-Treatments-Comparison
R in the Lab: Two Treatments Comparison

A brief R tutorial about how to perform a comparison analysis between two 
treatments data. This is performed through a t-Test, summarizing and graphing the data.

Please, consult the pdf_document.pdf or the github_document.md to see an 
explanation about the data analysis. Note that I didn't explain how I simulated
the experimental data, but you can see the code on data_simulation.R

If you have cloned this repository and want to run this analysis from scratch 
first run era_all_outputs.R script and then run Main.R script.
