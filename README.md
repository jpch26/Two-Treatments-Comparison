R in the Lab: Two Treatments Comparison
================

A brief R tutorial about how to perform a comparison analysis between
two treatments data. This is performed through a t-Test, summarizing and
graphing the data.

Note that I didn’t explain how I simulated the experimental data, but
you can see the code on data\_simulation.R

If you have cloned this repository and want to run this analysis from
scratch first run erase\_all\_outputs.R script and then run Main.R
script o whichever script you want.

The image and Two Treatments Comparison\_files folders contain images that 
I’ve used on the presentation that you can read by click on: [Two Treatments Comparison](https://github.com/jpch26/Two-Treatments-Comparison/blob/main/Two%20Treatments%20Comparison.md)
